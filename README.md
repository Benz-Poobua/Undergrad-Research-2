## Introduction
With the advent of high-sensitivity seismic observation networks and the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) observation networks, aseismic slip phenomena known as slow earthquakes have been discovered. Slow earthquakes are an intermediate type of fault slip between regular earthquakes and stable sliding (Obara & Kato, 2016). The mechanism of slow earthquakes is the same as that of regular earthquakes, except for their longer duration. Slow earthquakes are sometimes accompanied by seismic emissions called tremor (Beroza & Ide, 2011). Such slow earthquakes can be divided according to their characteristic time scale: short-term SSEs with durations of days to weeks or long-term SSEs with durations of months to years (Obara & Kato, 2016). 

The Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ) lies off the west coast from Northern Vancouver Island to Cape Mendocino, California. The CSZ is a convergent plate boundary where the Juan de Fuca, Explorer, and Gorda plates subduct underneath the North American plate. Numerous phenomena are observed within this region, such as megathrust earthquakes, with the most recent event in the year 1700 (Satake et al., 1996). While the CSZ produces lower levels of seismicity than other subduction zones, there are abundant slow slip and low-frequency tremors, commonly known as episodic tremor and slip (ETS) in the downdip zone of the seismogenic zone (Dragert et al., 2004). ETS is located downdip from the locked zone of the subduction plate interface between 25- and 45-km-depth contours (Peng & Gomberg, 2010). 

SSEs play an essential role in accommodating relative plate motion and transferring stress to the seismogenic zone. Uchida et al. (2016) studied periodic slow slip events in northern Japan and found they preceded or coincided with large earthquakes, contributing to periodic stress perturbations and subsequent seismic events. These similar scenarios can be seen elsewhere. For instance, in northern Chile, a SSE was detected less than a month before the 2014 Mw 8.2 Iquique earthquake took place in the same region (Ruiz et al., 2014). Long-term SSEs may also trigger tremors in the adjacent downdip zone, as observed in the Bungo channel and Mexico (Obara & Kato, 2016). Even more, long-term SSEs may have triggered the subsequent short-term SSEs–as observed in New Zealand (Wallace et al., 2012). ​​Given their potential to load the locked zone and trigger large earthquakes, studying SSEs in the CSZ is crucial for understanding the seismic cycle.

Although long-term SSEs (e.g., in Nankai) are numerically modeled to occur between the locked zone of megathrust events and the regions where ETS or short-term SSEs occur (Matsuzawa et al., 2013), Hyndman (2013) identified a spatial gap between the downdip limit of seismogenic zone and the ETS zone. Subsequently, Nuyen and Schmidt (2021) examined the long-term SSEs in Cascadia. However, cm-scale surface deformation was not observed through the GNSS time series in Cascadia. Instead, they proposed the possible low-amplitude SSEs (i.e., mm-scale surface deformation). After examining the gap, they discovered the low-amplitude long-term slow slip in Cascadia through careful filtering to remove relevant signals from noise, short-term SSEs, and secular tectonics. They concluded that non-tectonic events (e.g., soil moisture or snow water equivalent) were unlikely to explain the transient signals. One long-term SSE in southern Cascadia and three poorly resolved events were detected.

In this study, we investigate three poorly resolved surface deformation transients identified in southern Washington, northern Oregon, and northern California. Our goal is to examine these transients using sea level data (from tide gauge observations) and assess the correlation between this dataset and the observed signals. Essentially, ocean tides load the crustal surface, resulting in small displacements up to several mm for both horizontal and vertical directions, as seen in Alaska (Martens & Simons, 2020). 

By analyzing the relationship between water level fluctuations and the detected transients, we can determine whether these signals are of tectonic origin (i.e., SSEs), environmental loading of the crust, or artifacts. This analysis will provide insights into the nature of these events and their implications for understanding seismic processes in the CSZ.
## Methods
The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data from the Pacific Northwest Geodetic Array (PANGA) are used to measure the deformation of the surface.  Sea level data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) measure fluctuation of the water height relative to the land.  In this study, we are interested in and utilize the cleaned GNSS data in the east component. Water Level data from NOAA are resampled using a sampling rate of 24 hours to obtain daily water-level data. We remove the high-frequency noise by applying a 30-day moving average for both datasets. To compare the two data sets, we calculate the correlation coefficient using the Python library (NumPy). Setting a one-year window on those derived datasets, we can calculate the correlation between the GNSS and water level data in each timeframe. Correlation coefficients close to 0 suggest that the signals are of tectonic origin, while those close to 1 or -1 imply the tidal loading effects.

To compare these two parameters (displacements and water level), GPS stations are paired with the nearest NOAA stations (Table 1). The interested timeframe of these pairs is plus or minus two years of the observed events (Nuyen & Schmidt, 2021) in each state: Washington, 2015 to 2020; Oregon, 2006 to 2011; and California, 2015 to 2020. Missing data and artifacts from the equipment changes are considered, resulting in truncating of some datasets. The details of each station and raw data access are available in the Supplementary Data.
