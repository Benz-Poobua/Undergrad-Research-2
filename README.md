## Introduction
With the advent of high-sensitivity seismic observation networks and the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) observation networks, aseismic slip phenomena known as slow earthquakes have been discovered. Slow earthquakes are the intermediate type of fault slip between regular rupture or earthquakes in the locked zone and stable sliding in the creeping zone (Obara & Kato, 2016). The mechanism of slow earthquakes is the same as that of regular earthquakes, except for their longer duration. Slow earthquakes, therefore, generate weak-detectable seismic waves (Beroza & Ide, 2011). Such slow earthquakes can be divided according to their characteristic time scale: short-term SSEs with durations of days or long-term SSEs with durations of months or years (Obara & Kato, 2016). 
The Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ) lies off the west coast from Northern Vancouver Island to Cape Mendocino, California. The CSZ is a convergent plate boundary where the Juan de Fuca, Explorer, and Gorda plates subduct underneath the North American plate. Numerous phenomena are observed within this region, such as megathrust earthquakes; the most recent event in the year 1700 is proposed by Satake et al. (1996). Later, episodes of slip and low-frequency tremors were found to be correlated in northern Cascadia and have been known as the episodic tremor and slip (ETS) phenomenon in the downdip zone of the seismogenic zone (Dragert et al., 2004). Also, quasi-static slips or slow slip events (SSEs) that can slip significantly slowly without strong shaking have been located downdip from the locked zone of the subduction plate interface between 25- and 45-km-depth contours (Peng & Gomberg, 2010) between stable slip zones. 
SSEs play an essential role in accommodating relative plate motion and transferring stress to the seismogenic zone. Uchida et al. (2016) studied periodic slow slip events in northern Japan and found they preceded or coincided with large earthquakes, contributing to periodic stress perturbations and subsequent seismic events. These similar scenarios can be seen elsewhere. For instance, in northern Chile, an SSE was detected less than a month before the 2014 Mw 8.2 Iquique earthquake took place in the same region (Ruiz et al., 2014). Long-term SSEs may also trigger tremors in the adjacent downdip zone, as observed in the Bungo channel and Mexico (Obara & Kato, 2016). Even more, long-term SSEs may have triggered the subsequent short-term SSEs–as observed in New Zealand (Wallace et al., 2012). ​​Given their potential to load the locked zone and trigger large earthquakes, studying SSEs, particularly long-term ones, in the CSZ is crucial for understanding the seismic cycle.
Although long-term SSEs (e.g., in Nankai) are numerically modeled to occur between the locked zone of megathrust events and the regions where ETS or short-term SSEs occur (Matsuzawa et al., 2013), Hyndman (2013) identified a spatial gap between the downdip limit of seismogenic zone and the ETS zone. Subsequently, Nuyen and Schmidt (2021) examined the long-term SSEs in Cascadia. However, cm-scale surface deformation was not observed through the GNSS time series in Cascadia. Instead, they proposed the possible low-amplitude SSEs (i.e., mm-scale surface deformation). After examining the gap, they discovered the low-amplitude long-term slow slip in Cascadia through careful filtering to remove relevant signals from noise, short-term SSEs, and secular tectonics. They ensured that non-tectonic events (e.g., soil moisture or snow water equivalent) were irrelevant to the transient signals. One long-term SSE in southern Cascadia and three unresolved events were detected.
In this study, we focus on investigating the three unresolved transients identified in southern Washington, northern Oregon, and northern California. Our goal is to examine these transients using water level data (tidal loading) and assess the correlation between this dataset and the observed signals. By analyzing the relationship between water level fluctuations and the detected transients, we can determine whether these signals are real low-amplitude long-term SSEs or artifacts. This analysis will provide insights into the nature of these events and their implications 
for understanding seismic processes in the CSZ.
